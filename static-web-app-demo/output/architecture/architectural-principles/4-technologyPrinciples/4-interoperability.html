<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>
<p>Imagine if every computer had different software and hardware that didn’t work with other computers. It would be very hard to share information or do things together. That’s why we have standards to make sure that our software and hardware can work together.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Standards help us in many ways. They make sure that everything works together smoothly so that we can manage our systems better and be happy with what we are doing. They also help us save money by making sure that we don’t have to buy new things all the time because everything works together well.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, people might want to do something different. But if we do that, it might make it harder to use or integrate. So, you have to have a really good reason.</li>
<li>To make sure that everyone/everything is following the same rules and playing together nicely, we need to have a way of checking that everyone is doing what they’re supposed to be doing. We also need to make sure that we keep checking the rules every once in a while to make sure that they still work and are fair for everyone.</li>
<li>Before we can start playing the game, we need to know what we’re playing with. So, we need to find out what things we already have and how they work. This way, we can make sure that everything works together nicely.</li>
</ul>
