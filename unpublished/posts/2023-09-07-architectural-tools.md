Lead: Using the right tools can make a job much easier, but think about where work will end up.

## Introduction

I was recently told that any article about building practice should cover the use of tools as well. So figured I should write something about it.
This will be my opinion, drawn from my own experience. Sorry for that.

## Creating, Structuring and Managing Content

I have found a lot of architectural tools offer these sorts of benefits. To be honest, I find most professional tools do these things, but with a different view or focus.

What I have found to be most important is accessibility. Without access, people cannot use your content. To some degree, Confluence is a good place to work, but does the licensing model help or hinder it? I have always found it important to work where your audience can access it.

I have also observed that having common tools, language and traditions helps to build community and understanding. As these are important things to have, even in tech communities, sharing traditions, tools and language makes everyone more relatable.

So I advocate that architects accept some small discomfort, work where the teams they support work and encourage everyone to join their data and information together.

## Work Tracking

What do your neighbouring teams use?

* Jira
* Monday
* Trello
* To-Do
* Planner

All work fine. There may be better tools to track or ones which understand architect-speak, but these make your work visible and easy to see.

## Content authoring

What do your supported teams use?

* Word (probably the most accessible)
* Visual Studio (Code) (Markdown is a good option)
* Diagrams.net (Great for pictures and images)

Again, it wants to be accessible, easy to use and cost-effective. Don't underestimate the cost of operating or running systems just for architecture.

## Content Hosting

Depends on the content, but I have had great success with GitHub or Static websites. They're cheap and secure. It does limit formats somewhat, but the simplification of using Markdown means the content, not its formatting, has to be good.

Separating formatting removes a huge amount of mental load from creation.

## Governance and Management

In terms of managing content, I find Grammarly works well at managing quality. I've not played with the brand voice tools, but I can see how that could help.

Changes to the core architecture (Principles, Standards, approved patterns) or technology exceptions should be managed slowly, and through the ARB. The easy route should be to follow the rules and principles. Making it too simple to change has a risk for disruption and chaos, but making it too hard to change risks becoming hidebound and inflexible. This balance will be unique to your organisation.

I also find, that once you have a degree of simple, acceptance for architecture, then look at how to make life easier.

If you make it easy to make architecture, people make more of it, and that is rarely a good thing, as you create niche cases and encode them in the 'by-laws' of the business. If you have more than you can easily manage as a team, you probably have too much. If you don't have enough architects, it may be that you need to make less architecture, than hire more, until the business sees the value.

And then you need to maintain that balance. Each architect is overhead, but some overhead can help grease the wheels and encourage manageability and sustainable development. Too much is excessive and will create too much work.

Use the Pareto principle to govern your architectural work. You should -only- create the 20% of possible architecture which will deliver 80% of value. Anything outside that 'easy wins' space is likely too complex/niche for anyone else to care about, and that means you won't help clarify, you will complicate and work against the greater good of architecture.
