## Statement

Business keeps going even when systems break down.

## Rationale

We must ensure our systems work well because we use them a lot. We must think about how to avoid problems as we design and use them. We should be able to keep doing our work no matter what happens. Things like broken machines, lousy weather, or inaccurate data cannot stop us. We must have different ways to use information.

## Implications

This principle asks that we ensure our business is adequately resilient and prepared. It encourages us to look for substantial risks and effective mitigations appropriate to the system's value. It also wants us to focus on ensuring that our applications fit our intentions, especially regarding where we work and how easy it is for our people to adapt to changes.

* Data and Applications are available to our staff when they work away from the office.
* If you use shared applications, you need to know (and control) the risks of losing your business data and business functions.
* You can control the risks by checking systems regularly, testing for problems, and having backup plans for essential services.
* It would be best to consider how to recover, replace, and maintain your applications when designing them (before they break).
* You should know how vital your applications are for your business and what recovery plans you need.
