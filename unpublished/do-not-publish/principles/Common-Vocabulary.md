## Statement

Everyone in the company agrees on what data means, and they can easily find and understand it.

## Rationale

We need to use the correct words for the data we use to make apps. Using standard terms will help us share data and understand better. It will also help us connect systems and move data between them.

## Implications

This principle aims to help us keep things deliberately simple and ensure we all use the right words to describe the same things. Not following this principle causes confusion and delay, affecting our work.

Deliberately keeping things simple helps us communicate effectively, without ego, and ensures we can be as productive as possible. It also allows us to communicate with customers, people from outside our industry and people with other language backgrounds.

1. The people who are supposed to care for important information don’t always do a good job. We must ensure they have enough help and resources to do their job better. This will help us ensure we have good information we can trust.

2. We need to create a list of words that everyone in the company will use similarly. This glossary will help everyone understand each other better and avoid confusion.

3. When we need to make up a new word or phrase to describe something, we have to check with other people in the company to ensure everyone agrees on what it means. This way, everyone can understand what the new word or phrase means.

4. We will nominate someone to provide this coordination.

5. Having a shared understanding of data across an organisation is vital instead of having different data definitions in other places.

6. Coordinate data initiatives with centralised management to avoid wasted effort or added confusion.

7. Within each part of the organisation, someone must be accountable for data.
