Description: Authenticating users in microservices can be fraught with perils.

## Pattern Overview

This pattern describes a central authentication model suitable for a microservices web application. It builds on several other designs to provide a scalable way to identify, authenticate and authorise access to resources, data and services.

This example uses a role-based authorisation model. A policy-based authorisation model would be more flexible but also more complex.

### Illustration

![API Gateway Centralized authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/secure-net-microservices-web-applications/media/index/api-gateway-centralized-authentication.png)
> [Rousos (2023) Securing .NET Microservices and Web Applications, learn.microsoft.com.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/secure-net-microservices-web-applications/)(Accessed: 16 May 2023).â€Œ

This example is for a mobile app. A similar method would work for a static site, calling an API, a Single Page Application, or an MVC application. Use the [Backends-For-Frontends](https://akfpartners.com/growth-blog/backend-for-frontend#:~:text=In%20the%20Backend%20for%20Frontend%20pattern%2C%20a%20service,differ%20from%20a%20traditional%20API%20or%20monolithic%20gateway.) pattern to offset any differences.

## Benefits of this pattern

* By using the gateway, authentication is offloaded to the gateway and centralised, see [Gateways](xref:gateways).
* The gateway issues a signed token containing the authorised user's roles, which can be used for the token's lifespan, reducing chatter, see [Microservices Anti-patterns](xref:microservices-anti-patterns).
* The token is long-lived, reducing user frustration. See [Ease-of-Use](xref:ease-of-use).
* Once implemented, downstream services have their role added to the token and respect it.
* Identity management and storage can be offloaded to the customer's preferred vendor using open standards, Including:
  * Microsoft, Google or Facebook identities, such as Microsoft AzureAD B2C
  * Microsoft Azure AD identities, using B2B Federation
  * Any OpenID Connect or OAuth2.0 Identities.

## Drawbacks to this pattern

* It assumes simple role-based authorisation. A more complex policy-based model would require additional depth and complexity in the token, increasing its size and complexity.
* The token is easy to hack, so don't use it outside the network. A separate reference token model is recommended, where the token is used within the cluster and used by the gateway as a delegated authorisation.
  * The user would have a lean token or reference cookie, which only correlates to the token on the gateway. Think of this model as a delegation rather than an authorisation.
* This pattern creates a dependency on external identity vendors, which can be hard to manage.

## When to use this pattern

* In most enterprise or B2B microservice models, this pattern will be beneficial. It is ideal for a containerised application, which needs to minimise cross-talk and have a planned model for authorisation and identity.

## When to avoid this pattern

* This pattern is not suitable for use on unsecured networks. A malicious actor can use the token's contents to understand the user and their roles.
  * This pattern still promotes zero-trust, as every service will validate the token and must trust the issuer and check for tampering.
  * You can work around this limitation by using a reference token issued to the external user at the gateway, which does NOT contain identifiable information.
