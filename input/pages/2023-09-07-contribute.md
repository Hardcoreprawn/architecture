## How to contribute to Open-EA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open-EA.

Open-EA uses Github as a source repository and as such can be accessed on my personal Github account[https://github.com/Hardcoreprawn/architecture](https://github.com/Hardcoreprawn/architecture).

As I get time, I'll improve integration and instructions, so please bear with me.
