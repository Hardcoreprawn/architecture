# Architecture Repository

The main thing architects do, is create documents. These outline all manner of things which explain:
* Things we want to build
* Why we build things in particular ways
* How we build things
* Reasons for building things
* Things we do not want to build or reasons not to do it LIKE THAT.

This site covers some of the patterns and anti-patterns, Principles and Requirements, but also how to write them, what they should look linke or contain and any guidance we've managed to write along the way.

* [Architectural Principles](xref:Architectural-Principles)

* [Requirements](xref:Requirements)

* [Patterns and Anti-Patterns](xref:Patterns-And-Anti-Patterns)
