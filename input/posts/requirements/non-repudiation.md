Where possible, use immutable objects and data which can't be repudiated. Make sure we can trust our systems and our data.

> Read the [Requirements Check-List](xref:requirements-checklist) article for an introduction to requirements.

## Requirement

The system must provide a mechanism to ensure that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or message.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The system shall provide a digital signature for each transaction.
* The digital signature shall be unique for each transaction.
* The digital signature shall be verified by the recipient of the transaction.

## Audience

  1. System designers and software engineers.
  2. IT Professionals and operational engineers.

## Details

* Owner: Andy Sheldon, Chief Technology Officer
* Author: James Brewster, Enterprise Architect

## Rationale

Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin, authenticity, and integrity of data. It assures the sender that the message was delivered, as well as proof of the senderâ€™s identity to the recipient. This way, neither party can deny that a message was sent, received, and processed. Non-repudiation ensures that no party can deny that it sent or received a message via encryption and/or digital signatures or approved some information. It also cannot deny the authenticity of its signature on a document.
