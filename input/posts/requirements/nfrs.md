Functional requirements describe why something is. Non-functional Requirements tell how it is. Where a customer may ask for a specific functional requirement, they are doubtful to ask for an NFR unless something is wrong.

The NFRs which go into a product can mean all manner of differences, which affect the cost, performance, and reliability of a product or solution.

Consider the following requirements and how they might affect the cost or development of a vehicle.

* Carries two passengers
* Can travel 200 miles
* Travels on roads
* A fuel efficiency greater than 30 miles per gallon.

Now, this could describe all manner of things. A motorbike? A tandem bicycle? A Sports car? These could all be right, but they meet the needs of different markets and result in differing products.

Defining how your product will perform specific tasks and how it will perform under load and in use is essential to create the proper differentiation and guidance for development.
