Downloading software from the internet is commonplace and a requirement for a lot of software development work. Ensuring you can trust the libraries, applications and scripts that have been downloaded is important to keep us all safe and employed.

## Requirement

Scripts, libraries and apps which have been downloaded from external sources are scanned for malware before execution. Apps are only used from signed, trusted sources to ensure they meet the standards of their authors.

Apps from third parties, used in our business, are part of our business architecture. These apps need to come from vendors and sources we can trust and verify.

If there is any indication or suspicion that the provenance of a piece of executable software is dubious, then it should not be used until it can be safely verified.

Consider the addition of application whitelisting/allow-listing and application sandboxing as ways to help mitigate risks.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Downloaded software has been scanned and found to be free from malware.
* The scanning engine has an up-to-date set of definitions.
* The applications are correctly signed by their authors.
* Their authors are traceable and can be verified.
* The use of the software and the ability of the vendor to support this use has been considered.

## Audience

  1. System designers and implementors.
  2. Organisational management

## Details

* Owner: Andy Sheldon, Chief Technology Officer
* Author: James Brewster, Enterprise Architect

## Rationale

We need to ensure our software is secure and trustworthy and that we can use it safely, at scale, for our business.
