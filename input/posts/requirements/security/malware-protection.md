Downloading software from the internet is commonplace and a requirement for most software development work. Ensuring you can trust downloaded libraries, applications, and scripts keeps us safe and employed.

## Requirement

Scan Scripts, libraries, and apps downloaded from external sources for malware before execution. Only use apps from signed, trusted sources to ensure they meet the standards of their authors. Make sure you accept those standards.

Apps from third parties used in our business are part of our business architecture. These apps need to come from vendors and sources we can trust and verify.

If there is any indication or suspicion that the provenance of a piece of executable software is dubious, then do not use it until it can be safely verified.

Consider the addition of application white-listing/allow-listing and application sandboxing as ways to help mitigate risks.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Downloaded software has been scanned and found to be free from malware.
* The scanning engine has an up-to-date set of definitions.
* Only applications with digital signatures from their vendors.
* The application authors are traceable and can be verified.
* Consider the software's use and the vendor's ability to support this use.

## Audience

  1. System designers and implementors.
  2. Organizational management

## Details

* Owner: Andy Sheldon, Chief Technology Officer
* Author: James Brewster, Enterprise Architect

## Rationale

We need to ensure our software is secure and trustworthy and that we can use it safely, at scale, for our business.
