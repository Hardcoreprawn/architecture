In the context of Broker Training

Facing the need to ensure brokers are properly trained to sell the relevaznt utility service

We decided for a broker training log, which will confirm acceptance and record the date

And against an eSignature or an immutable log

To acheive the proof that training was delivered, prior to using the system

Accepting that we will remain liable for any regulatory issues, caused by the broker or their agents.

Because, at this time, the risk of litigation or regulatory action is deemed low enough that we can make the quickest decision

Discussed with James Brewster, Peter Wilson and Jade Rawlings.
