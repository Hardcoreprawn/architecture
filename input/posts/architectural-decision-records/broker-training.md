  In the context of Broker Training
  
  Facing the need to adequately train brokers to sell utility service.
  
  We decided on a broker training log, which will confirm acceptance and record the date
  
  And against an eSignature or an immutable ledger.
  
  To achieve proof of training before using the system
  
  Accepting that we will remain liable for any regulatory issues caused by the broker or their agents.

  Because, at this time, the risk of litigation or regulatory action is deemed low enough that we can make the quickest decision

Discussed with James Brewster, Peter Wilson and Jade Rawlings.
