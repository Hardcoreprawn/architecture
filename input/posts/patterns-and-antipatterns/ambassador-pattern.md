TODO: An Ambassador sits between two services and negotiates. Typically a proxy
service can interpret. An ambassador is often used to offload or mask client
interoperability issues. An ambassador is a specialized sidecar.

TODO: deploy helper apps into separate containers to encapsulate them, but keep
them close for performance.
