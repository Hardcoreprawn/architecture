## Pattern Overview

This pattern describes a central authentication model, suitable for a microservices web application. It builds on several other patterns, to provide a scalable way to identify, authenticate and authorise access to resources, data and services.

In this example, a role-based authorization model is being used. Customer policies would be more configurable, but also more complex.
