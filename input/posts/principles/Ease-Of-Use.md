## Statement

Applications are easy to use. The underlying technology is transparent to users so that they can concentrate on their tasks.

## Rationale

When you use something, it’s better if you don’t have to learn too much about how it works. It’s easier to use when it’s simple. Simplicity makes it easier to do your work and not make mistakes. It keeps data in the right places and reduces the likelihood of people mistreating it.

## Implications

We want our software to be easy to use and accessible to the biggest audience we can serve. We do not want the complexity of our systems to hinder a sale or add any impediment to our business.

1. Apps and websites should look and feel similar and be easy to use. Some rules are made to make sure that all applications follow these standards. Test these rules to make sure that they are easy to use.
2. People should not assume everyone using apps is the same when making things like websites or apps. Application developers should ensure that everyone can use these applications, no matter their country, language, computer knowledge, or if they have additional needs.

### Details and Context

* Accessibility
* White Label
