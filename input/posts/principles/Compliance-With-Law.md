## Statement

Our processes for optimising, storing, and processing the data we hold or create will follow all the relevant laws, policies and regulations.

## Rationale

Enterprise policy refers to a set of rules and guidelines that an organisation creates to govern its actions. Part of our enterprise policy is to comply with laws, policies, and regulations. However, this does not prevent business process improvements that may lead to changes.

## Implications

This principle tells us to follow the law and associated good practices.

* The enterprise must comply with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding data collection, retention, and management.
* Department heads will ensure their employees are educated about these rules and have access to them.
* We will adapt our processes and applications as the law and regulations change.
