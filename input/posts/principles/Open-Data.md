## Statement

Data sharing is a key component of our business strategy. We believe that sharing data within our company and with external partners can help us to achieve our goals and improve our services.

## Rationale

We are committed to making our data open and accessible to our employees and partners, while also protecting the privacy and security of our customers and stakeholders. We will work to ensure that our data is secure, accurate, up-to-date, and relevant and that it is shared in a way that is transparent, ethical, and responsible.

## Implications

This principle is mostly about ensuring that people who are allowed to get data, can get it when they want it. We can control who that is, and we have to make sure we handle data following the law. This isn't creating a free for all. It's making sure we have data in useful formats, so we can make decisions with it.

* By making data open and accessible, the company can increase transparency and accountability, both internally and externally.
* Sharing data within the company and with external partners can help to improve collaboration and innovation, leading to better products and services.
* Access to current, accurate data can help employees and partners make better decisions.
* By sharing data, the company can avoid duplication of effort and reduce costs, leading to greater efficiency.
* By being open and transparent with data, the company can improve its reputation and build trust with customers and stakeholders.
