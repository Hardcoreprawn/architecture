## Statement

Data sharing is a key component of our business strategy. We believe that sharing data within our company and with external partners can help us to achieve our goals and improve our services.

## Rationale

We are committed to making our data open and accessible to our employees and partners, while also protecting the privacy and security of our customers and stakeholders. We will work to ensure that our data is secure, accurate, up-to-date, and relevant and that it is shared in a way that is transparent, ethical, and responsible.

## Implications

This principle is mostly about ensuring that people who are allowed to get data, can get it when they want it. We can control who that is, and we have to make sure we handle data following the law. This isn't creating a free for all. It's making sure we have data in useful formats, so we can make decisions with it.

* By making data open and accessible, the company can increase transparency and accountability, both internally and externally.
* Sharing data within the company and with external partners can help to improve collaboration and innovation, leading to better products and services.
* Access to more data can help employees and partners make better decisions, based on more accurate and up-to-date information.
* By sharing data, the company can avoid duplication of effort and reduce costs, leading to greater efficiency.
* By being open and transparent with data, the company can improve its reputation and build trust with customers and stakeholders.

## Benefits of an Open Data Model

Open Data has become increasingly common in public sector organisations but has benefits for Private Businesses as well, especially those who work in network enterprises, such as utilities. Open Data refers to data being open, **within a community.** You only need to make the data available to authorised, appropriate people.

Sharing data in a way that is open and transparent has been shown to improve innovation and create insights, which in turn generate social and economic benefits. This is explored in a McKinsey paper[^1], linked below. Redfin and Zillow both disrupted the property market in the US by using open property data to enrich searches and add additional detail about properties, including school catchment and telecoms availability.
