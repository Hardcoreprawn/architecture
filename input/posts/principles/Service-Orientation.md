## Statement

The architecture is designed to mimic real-world business activities that are part of the company’s processes. It’s like a blueprint for how the company should operate.

## Rationale

Service orientation is a way of designing computer software that focuses on providing services that can be accessed by different users and applications. Service orientation aims to make the software more flexible, reusable and adaptable to changing needs.

Service orientation means that the company is designed to be flexible and adaptable to change. It’s like a chameleon that can change its colours to blend in with its environment.

## Implications

Our systems and architecture follow our business. We build a sensible business, with sensible systems. We don't slavishly and recklessly mutilate systems to fit the business, but we do not bend the business to fit the systems.

* We use business descriptions to help understand how to implement services.
* Open standards make sure that our services can work together.
* We need to describe our services in a way that makes sense for their specific environment
* We have strong rules in place for how to represent and implement our services.
* There are standard tests to determine if our services are good or not.
