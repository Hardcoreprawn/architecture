## Statement

We try to use a limited number of technologies to reduce the cost of maintaining expertise and connectivity between multiple systems. By doing so, we minimise the complexity of our systems and reduce costs.

## Rationale

When companies use too many different technologies to do things, keeping everything working together becomes hard. Try to use fewer technologies to make things simpler and cheaper. This way, we can save money and make things work better.

## Implications

Let's be clear; we like diversity. But technical variety is different, as it's more about the ecosystem of compatibility than any intrinsic bias. We want to choose a simple path, and various vendors will complicate matters, standards and interoperability. So we are careful with who we pick and who we invite in, as we all want a more leisurely life with less waste.

* When choosing which technologies to use, we must follow specific rules.
* These rules help us choose technologies that work well together and are easy to use.
* If we need to use a new technology that is not in the rules, we must ensure it works with the other technologies we already use.
* We also have to make sure it will make things better or more straightforward and not more complicated.
