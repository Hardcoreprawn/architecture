## Introduction

One of the most important things a product manager can do is ensure that only critical work is prioritised. Any work which you want to do needs to be the most valuable thing.

How do you make sure the work you do is valuable?

It's important to avoid 'make-work'. Thats not your job to keep developers busy or ensure backlogs are stuffed. If there's no valuable work ready, then don't propose it.

## Defining work

In the context of what we're discussing, your role as a product manager is to make sure that the most important work, the things your customers need the most, is prioritised and managed to release.

Let's break this down.

* 'The things your customers need'. I say need on purpose. Not want. They may not know what they need. They will want a lot of things. They may try to strongarm you for something, which won't improve their lives or work. Try to avoid these. Be sceptical, no matter who tells you it's important.

> As we're talking B2B Software as a Service, sometimes you will just have to make features to win deals and they won't help anyone in the long run. Thats life. Minimise it.

* 'Prioritised'. Important word. Your part in this is not to dictate the backlog. It is to provide direction and priority. If developers say something has to be done or come first, that's ok. They are unlikely to lie if they see the value in your features. By ensuring you only push for priority when it is critical, you will have more luck getting it.

* 'Managed to release'. If it's not released, it may as well not have been written. Until that carefully designed feature is in the hands of customers, it would have been a better investment left in the bank. Maybe even in Bitcoins...

### Types of work

Most work in a business fits into two categories.

1. Planned Work
2. Unplanned work.

Everyone knows about both of these. The first one is what people expect to take time and deliver value. The second one happens and you just have to cope with it.

To make sure you can deal with your timelines realistically, just assume that a backlog will be 50:50 planned and unplanned work. How do you plan for unplanned work?

You leave space.

The worst thing which will happen is the team have time to learn something or implement something early. Or deal with what needs to be done.

So 50% of the backlog is left free, until sprint planning. Any features which are accepted over 50%, shouldn't be committed or expected, they should be nice to have.

Planned work broadly falls into two parts:

1. Business Projects
2. Internal Projects

If you let the work naturally fall into this ratio, 1:1, you should see the teams outperform expectations and get ahead of the backlog. Releases are much more likely to arrive when expected. You will look great.

## Creating and Defining work

Some of the best tools to understand how customers make use of your software are interviews. And some ways to capture these are:

* [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) - A way to articulate why people buy your product.
  * [Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/) - A way to understand adjacent tasks that you could adopt in your product to add value.
* [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) - A way to articulate how you create and exchange value in your product's business model. It also lets you model different business models, to explore other ways to exchange money for goods/services. A PM should be **the** expert in their products business model.
* [Business Experiments](https://www.strategyzer.com/test) - Ways to understand how people interact with products, features and services that can validate hypotheses.

So, we talk to customers and understand what they do and why. We map out what they do and what they need to do. Then we make that easy, in an economical way. And we test changes and run experiments, so our decisions are based on data and not opinion. Qualitative research is very valuable in a supporting context and adds colour and flavour. But Quantitative evidence is more likely to yield a positive result.

Some people will make a mind map. Some will write a document. Some record audio or use whiteboards (digital or other). You could use interpretive dance if that helped you process it.

Then we refine it. We take our partially moulded lump of clay and refine it. We throw bits out, we draw things up. As we go through the act of work, we refine and understand what we're talking about. You might need to go back and clarify some things, or re-review a particular process. This does not have to take too long; you may not have a lot of time. Any time will be valuable. Once you start to understand it, you will have some very valuable time, which will get less valuable as you uncover less and less. The best thing to do when you are 55-60% sure it's a good idea, which will make money and can be delivered is to test it, by shipping something.

Working with the topic in this way is what creates the understanding you need to be able to articulate this to a team of developers, who you couldn't conceivably get in the interview, and who would all have conflicting views. It needs to be rationalised and drawn together, then discussed and agreed upon before being committed. Your goal is to reach a 'to the balance of probability,m this is a good idea', which you can gamble on. If you keep the risk of failure down, by keeping it small, then it will be easier to test and try out.

Before this, we are talking about the concept only. The key elements you need to have understood all revolve around the business model, the customer jobs and the ability of the company to deliver. You should be able to actively answer these questions before you ask anyone to work on something:

* Does the market need it? - NOT a customer, but the market as a whole. Is it a real gap, or a customer process issue?
* Will the market pay for it? - Again, will it improve the flow of money within the company?
* Is it urgent? - Do they need it now? Not tomorrow, or in a year or two.

If multiple customers don't want to give you more money because of it, and really soon, then why are you doing it? If your CEO stops and asks you what the value is, you should be prepared to drop facts and data to fight for that feature.

## Planning Work

Once you have the essence of a Product Requirements Document (PRD) structured and reviewed (and it can take **months** to do this properly and get agreement when the business is not ready or the feature is too big, or the case is not simple and compelling...) and everyone is committed to the idea of this lovely new feature, then how do you get the dev team to deliver it?

You have to break it down. Factoring. A bit like equations.

You simplify and break down work items into separate related features, if necessary. Trying to throw out anything you don't have to do right now. You want this to be lean and fast to deliver. Once you engage dev teams in more than talk, it starts to get pricey, so you want to maximise that return on time.

Once you understand and have broken down the PRD into features, before you have more than the bones of critical requirements, get the work all broken into work items, such as features and stories, in your tool of choice.

Review requirements in small groups, ideally feature by feature, but in the tool. Get your technical opposite to comment, and add in any NFRs that apply or prerequisites. Don't lead at this point, let others arrange the requirements and features naturally. Let them have a delivery plan. That's their role and they are better at it than you ;).

You will find that work grows this way. Your role is now to defend the scope. Do not let others inflate it unnecessarily. If it conceivably can be delayed to a second release, let it be so. You aim to get through this next stage as quickly as is sensible, to get the feature out into the next possible release, with a minimum of invested time. So you can evaluate whether it works as expected.
