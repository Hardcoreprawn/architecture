## Introduction

One of the most important things a product manager can do is ensure that only critical work is prioritised. Any work which you want to do needs to be the most valuable thing.

How do you make sure the work you do is valuable?

It's important to avoid 'make-work'. Thats not your job to keep developers busy or ensure backlogs are stuffed. If there's no valuable work ready, then don't propose it.

## Defining work

In the context of what we're discussing, your role as a product manager is to make sure that the most important work, the things your customers need the most, is prioritised and managed to release.

Let's break this down.

* 'The things your customers need'. I say need on purpose. Not want. They may not know what they need. They will want a lot of things. They may try to strongarm you for something, which won't improve their lives or work. Try to avoid these. Be sceptical, no matter who tells you it's important.

> As we're talking B2B Software as a Service, sometimes you will just have to make features to win deals and they won't help anyone int he long run. Thats life. Minimise it.

* 'Prioritised'. Important word. Your part in this is not to dictate the backlog. It is to provide direction and priority. If developers say something has to be done or come first, that's ok. They are unlikely to lie if they see the value in your features. By ensuring you only push for priority when it is critical, you will have more luck getting it.

* 'Managed to release'. If it's not released, it may as well not have been written. Until that carefully designed feature is in the hands of customers, it would have been a better investment left in the bank.

### Types of work

Most work in a business fits into two categories.

1. Planned Work
2. Unplanned work.

Everyone knows about both of these. The first one is what people expect to take time and deliver value. The second one happens and you just have to cope with it.

To make sure you can deal with your timelines realistically, just assume that a backlog will be 50:50 planned and unplanned work. How do you plan for unplanned work?

You leave space.

The worst thing which will happen is the team have time to learn something or implement something early. Or deal with what needs to be done.

So 50% of the backlog is left free, until sprint planning. Any features which are accepted over 50%, shouldn't be committed or expected, they should be nice to have.

Planned work broadly falls into two parts:

1. Business Projects
2. Internal Projects

If you let the work naturally fall into this ratio, you should see the teams outperform expectations and get ahead of the backlog. Releases are much more likely to arrive when expected. You will look great.

## Creating and Defining work

Some of the best tools to understand how customers make use of your software are interviews. And some ways to capture these are:

* [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) - A way to articulate why people buy your product.
  * [Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/) - A way to understand adjacent tasks that you could adopt in your product.
* [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) - A way to articulate how you create and exchange value in your product's business model. It also lets you model different business models, to explore other ways to exchange money for goods/services.
* [Business Experiments](https://www.strategyzer.com/test) - Ways to understand how people interact with products, features and services that can validate hypotheses.

So, we talk to customers and understand what they do and why. We map out what they do and what they need to do. Then we make that easy, in an economical way. And we test changes and run experiments, so our decisions are based on data and not opinion. Qualitative research is very valuable in a supporting context and adds colour and flavour. But Quantitative evidence is more likely to yield a positive result.
