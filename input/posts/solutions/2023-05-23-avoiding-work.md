## Introduction

One of the most important things a product manager can do is ensure that only critical work is prioritised. Any work which you want to do needs to be the most valuable thing.

How do you make sure the work you do is valuable?

It's important to avoid 'make-work'. Thats not your job to keep developers busy or ensure backlogs are stuffed. If there's no valuable work ready, then don't propose it.
