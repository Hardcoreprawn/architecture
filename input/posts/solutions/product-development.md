During the initial case for the feature or investment, Product Management teams need to include a release plan. An important part of the release is what we expect it to do, and how it improves the market position of the business.

* Will it make the software more accessible to the market?
* Will it improve market traction?
* Will it reduce the customers operational costs?

Identifying how you expect a collection of features to provide a return on investment is an important discussion point when considering any software investment.

## Business Case

Making a case for a new feature or major product change is typically the remit of a product manager. The actual feature could come from anywhere, but the process of refining the idea, understanding the return and market impact; this is where a product manager really makes their pay.

### Defining Market Impact

Before any form of discovery; when the feature is in a nascent form; pre-zygotic in it's infancy, the PM should be able to articulate 3 things:

1. Who wants this feature, and why do they want it?
2. Will they pay for it?
3. Do they need it now?

These points form the crux of a market defining feature. If there is an significant investment, it should be because a measurable chunk fo the market wants it, will pay for it and will do so now.

* Need
* Importance
* Urgency

### Product Marketing

The next area to understand is how are you going to tell the world about this new feature that it needs so badly? Can you reach this audience to tell them? Do you know where they hang out? Are there places where you can tell them all at once? Are you going to have to talk them individually?

Once you understand the cost of telling them, and you have an idea of how the feature could affect the market impact, you are ready to make a case.
