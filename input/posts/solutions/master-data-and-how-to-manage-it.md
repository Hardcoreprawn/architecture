## Introduction

Master data management (MDM) is the organisation of people, processes and technologies to create and maintain an authoritative, reliable, sustainable, accurate, and secure data environment representing a “single version of the truth” for master data and its relationships across the enterprise. MDM involves creating a single master record for each person, place, or thing in a business across internal and external data sources and applications. This information has been de-duplicated, reconciled and enriched, becoming a consistent, reliable source. Through MDM, an organisation can disseminate consistent and accurate master data across its entire enterprise.

Master data management (MDM) has several benefits. It helps businesses drive efficiencies, improve data quality, revenue growth, and customer experience. MDM also ensures data consistency and accuracy and avoids fluctuations in how closely data flow tracks the underlying patterns. With MDM capabilities, organisations can improve their master data quality, resulting in fewer errors and less redundancy. Some benefits of establishing master data management include improving efficiencies and having all your organisation’s most critical data up to date in one shared location.

## MDM Strategy

At Everflow, our mission is to simplify our customer's utility needs. We need to understand their use of utilities and be able to track how we can align their use.

Our MDM strategy reflects this. Its goals are to:

* Provide a single view of the customer and their use of our products, so they can quickly see how their usage varies and make educated decisions.
* To support their brokers and support agents to get the correct information quickly and easily, so we can continue to deliver excellent customer service.
To support and not detract from our main value proposition by offering a lightweight solution which aligns with our values and principles.

We will achieve these goals:

* By identifying and managing our Core Master Data, required to create integrated customer experiences
* Through maintaining authoriative sources, which the broader organisation can easily access
* Ensuring our data stewardship is fit for purpose as our regulated footprint grows
* By providing a lightweight service which delivers the necessary functionality in a cost-effective manner
