## Strategy

Everflow's strategy is to court brokers to offer water and waste services to SME clients. Whilst these services are low margin, brokers see them as a defensive sale, to prevent other brokers or retailers from accessing the client.

Everflow will look to its ease of use, customer service and environmental credentials to differentiate itself, whilst remaining price comparable. To achieve this, Everflow will need to rely on effective processes and automation to keep the cost of service low.

Everflow is also creating a positive, disruptive image by keeping its retail pricing transparent and making sure customers can see the wholesale cost, fluctuations and a fixed retail uplift.

Growth and performance will also be important to maintain a positive brand and image, enforcing the position of a challenger and an innovator.

To support its position as a leader in the field, Everflow actively participates in regulatory advisory groups for the markets in which it operates.

## Enterprise Context

Explaining how Everflow interacts with other organisations as part of their common enterprise.

![Everflow, Enterprise Context](../../media/everflow-enterprise-context.png)

Everflow aggregates regional water authorities to SME customers, in England and Scotland, then integrates quoting and billing. The ideal customer has sites across several counties and water authorities.

Everflow uses three channels to market:

* 10% Direct Sales
* 90% Broker Sales

Some % of the Brokers are called brokers but use a white-labelled platform or an API, they are resellers and don't sell Eveflow, more use Everflow to provide services.

A key advantage of using brokers is that Everflow was able to get traction by being added alongside a higher-value service. A lot of Brokers use Everflow, so they can easily offer water alongside more lucrative Energy utilities, without having to handle the complex and low margin leg-work involved.

## Business Value Stream

Shows how Everflow creates value, through its primary water business

![Everflow, Business Value Stream](../../media/everflow-value-stream.png)

Everflow creates value by aggregating data about water suppliers and helping a customer to select from all the possible options, by providing guided recommendations. In itself, this is fairly simple. However, Everflow can do this for every site in your business, which is a significant and complex exercise for businesses with several sites.

As the water and wastewater markets have become increasingly deregulated, this has created a lot of choice and complexity. This is where Everflow works.

Everflow sells through 3 separate channels

1. Direct Sales
2. Broker Sales
3. Resellers, who sell the service as their own.

Everflows primary product is the supply contract for Water, Waste Water and Commercial Waste Services. This is a complex set of clauses around the provision of these three utility services at 1+ commercial sites.

The value is in the contextual jobs of the task than in the task itself. Commercial water is not too complex until you have a lot of sites. Then, managing regional providers becomes a challenge. Everflow removes the contextual jobs around 'provide water' and 'remove wastewater' from the customer.

## Organisation Chart

Organisation charts change over time. It's better to work from a value stream and capabilities, and then map them to the chart, as then the chart can keep changing.
