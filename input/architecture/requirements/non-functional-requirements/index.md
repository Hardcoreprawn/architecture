NFRs are responsible for the positive user experience, the performance and resilience and security which make people trust your site, keep coming back, and minimise waste and churn.

If functional requirements determine what something does, NFRs determine how it does it.

In our scenario it makes sense to differentiate between NFRs for three audiences:
	• Everflow
	• Brokers
	• Customers
For now, we can discount Customers and Everflow; we're focussing on the Brokers as the largest group of users, Everflow staff need to have a nice life too, and they will use it more than others. As the direct digital channel grows, the customers audience becomes more important (based on the % of business)

Typically, our customers only care about the NFRs we aren't doing. And its situational which ones matter. When everything is fine and working, no one will notice them. When they fail to meet expectations, there will be hell to pay.

We'll use some language from the 'Jobs-to-be-done' framework for the next section.
