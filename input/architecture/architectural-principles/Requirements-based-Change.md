# Requirements-Based Change

![An abstract header in the style of Van Gogh](/media/images/header01.png)

> *"I’m always willing to accept change, just as long as it isn’t change for the sake of change. If that change will result in a better way of doing things, then I’m all for it." - James Van Fleet.*

## Statement

We only make changes to technology to make our business better, and we do that together.

## Rationale

When we need to change how we do things, we should be able to do so without being held back by our technology. Instead of changing how we do things because of our technology, we can change our technology to better fit our changing needs. This way, we can make sure that our technology is helping us do what we need,instead of getting in the way.

## Implications

1. Before making any changes to the way we do things, we will look at how it will affect related things we do.
2. We will make sure that everyone knows how to make changes in a way that follows these rules.
3. Sometimes these rules might get in the way of making changes quickly. Thats ok and we can raise this as a blocker if need be.
4. Responsive change is also a principle. We need to respond quickly, we should also make sure that any response is based on a real need.
