## Statement

The architecture is designed to mimic real-world business activities that are part of the company’s processes. It’s like a blueprint for how the company should operate.

## Rationale

Service orientation delivers enterprise agility and Boundaryless Information Flow.

Service orientation means that the company is designed to be flexible and adaptable to change. It’s like a chameleon that can change its colours to blend in with its environment.

Information can flow freely between different parts of the company without any barriers. It’s like a river that flows through different landscapes without any obstacles.

## Implications

* We use business descriptions to help understand how to implement services.
* Open standards  make sure that our services can work together.
* We need to describe our services in a way that makes sense for their specific environment
* We have strong rules in place for how to represent and implement our services.
* There are standard tests to determine if our services are good or not.
