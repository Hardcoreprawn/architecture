## Statement

When we change how we use our computers and software to store and share information, we need to make sure that these changes are done quickly and without delay.

## Rationale

If people are to be expected to work with technology, that technology must be easy to work with.

## Implications

We need to make changes quickly. If we wait too long, we annoy or worse, alienate people. So when you decide to change, do so quickly. And Plan changes. Communicate them effectively.

* When we want to make changes to how we do things, we should have a plan in place that doesn’t slow things down.
* If we want to make a change, we should talk to someone who knows about the company’s business so they can help make it happen.
* If changes are made, the people making the change should make sure everything still works together.
* Sometimes making these changes might cost more money or take more time than the company wants to spend.
* Sometimes these changes might not work well with other things the company is doing.
