## Statement

Applications are easy to use. The underlying technology is transparent to users, so they can concentrate on tasks at hand.

## Rationale

When you use something, it’s better if you don’t have to learn too much about how it works. It’s easier to use when it’s simple. This makes it easier for you to do your work and not make mistakes. It keeps data in the right places and reduces the likelihood of people mistreating it.

## Implications

We want our software to be easy to use and accessible to the biggest audience we can serve. We do not, ever, want the complexity of our systems to hinder a sale or add any impediment to our business.

1. App and websites should look and feel similar to each other and be easy to use. So, there are rules that are made to make sure that all applications follow these standards. These rules are tested to make sure that they are easy to use.

2. When people make things like websites or apps, they should not assume that everyone who uses them is the same. They should make sure that everyone can use them no matter where they are from, what language they speak, how much they know about computers, or if they have any physical problems.

### Details and Context

* Accessibility
* White Label
