> *“The early bird gets the worm.” — William Camden, author & antiquarian, 1551-1623*

## Statement

When we change how we use our computers and software to store and share information, we need to make sure that these changes are done quickly and without delay.

## Rationale

If people are to be expected to work with technology, that technology must be easy to work with.

## Implications

* When we want to make changes to how we do things, we should have a plan in place that doesn’t slow things down.
* If we want to make a change, we should talk to someone who knows about the company’s business so they can help make it happen.
* If changes are made, the people making the change should make sure everything still works together.
* Sometimes making these changes might cost more money or take more time than the company wants to spend.
* Sometimes these changes might not work well with other things the company is doing.
