<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>
<p>Our processes for the optimization, storage, and processing of the data we create and use, follow all the relevant laws, policies and regulations.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Enterprise policy refers to a set of rules and guidelines that an organization creates to govern its actions. Part of our enterprise policy is to comply with laws, policies, and regulations. However, this does not prevent business process improvements that may lead to changes.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>The enterprise must comply with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, and management of data.</li>
<li>Employees must be educated about these rules and have access to them.</li>
<li>We will adapt our processes and applications as as the law and regulations change.</li>
</ul>
