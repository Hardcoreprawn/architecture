<p><em>&quot;Don’t say ‘infinitely’ when you mean ‘very’; otherwise you’ll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite.&quot; - George Orwell</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>
<p>Everyone in the company agrees on what data means, and they can easily find and understand it.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>We need to use the same words for the data we use to make apps. This will help us share data and talk better. It will also help us connect systems and move data between them.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>The people who are supposed to take care of important information don’t always do a good job. We need to make sure they have enough help and resources so they can do their job better. This will help us make sure we have good information that we can trust.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We need to create a list of words that everyone in the company will use in the same way. This will help everyone understand each other better and avoid confusion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When we need to make up a new word or phrase to describe something, we have to check with other people in the company to make sure that everyone agrees on what it means. This way, everyone can understand what the new word or phrase means.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will nominate someone to provide this co-ordination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is important to have a common understanding of data across an organization instead of having different definitions of data in different places.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data initiatives need to be co-ordinated, with centralised management.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Someone, within each part of the organisation, has to be accountable for data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
