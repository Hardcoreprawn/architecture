<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>
<p>We try to use a limited number of technologies to reduce the cost of maintaining expertise in and connectivity between multiple systems. By doing so, we  minimize the complexity of our systems and reduce costs.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>When companies use too many different technologies to do things, it can be very expensive to keep everything working together. So, companies try to use fewer technologies to make things simpler and cheaper. This way, they can save money and make things work better. It’s like having fewer toys to play with so you don’t have to worry about cleaning them away.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we choose which technologies to use, we have to follow certain rules.</li>
<li>These rules help us choose technologies that work well together and are easy to use.</li>
<li>If we need to use a new technology that is not in the rules, we have to make sure it works with the other technologies we are already using.</li>
<li>We also have to make sure it will make things better or easier and not harder.</li>
