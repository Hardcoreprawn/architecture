<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>
<p>When we change how we use our computers and software to store and share information, we need to make sure that these changes are done quickly and without delay.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>If people are to be expected to work with technology, that technology must be easy to work with.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we want to make changes to how we do things, we should have a plan in place that doesn’t slow things down.</li>
<li>If we want to make a change, we should talk to someone who knows about the company’s business so they can help make it happen.</li>
<li>If changes are made, the people making the change should make sure everything still works together.</li>
<li>Sometimes making these changes might cost more money or take more time than the company wants to spend.</li>
<li>Sometimes these changes might not work well with other things the company is doing.</li>
</ul>
