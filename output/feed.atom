&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I’m always willing to accept change, just as long as it isn’t change for the sake of change. If that change will result in a better way of doing things, then I’m all for it.&amp;quot; - James Van Fleet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only make changes to technology to make our business better, and we do that together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we need to change how we do things, we should be able to do so without being held back by our technology. Instead of changing how we do things because of our technology, we can change our technology to better fit our changing needs. This way, we can make sure that our technology is helping us do what we need, instead of getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We change because it's sensible, not because we have to. When we change, it's to make things better, not worse. We should consider everyone, and other changes and projects when we do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before making any changes to the way we do things, we will look at how it will affect related things we do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will make sure that everyone knows how to make changes in a way that follows these rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes these rules might get in the way of making changes quickly. That's okay and we can raise this as a blocker if need be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive change is also a principle. We need to respond quickly, we should also make sure that any response is based on a real need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.&amp;quot; - Albert Einstein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data sharing is a key component of our business strategy. We believe that sharing data within our company and with external partners can help us to achieve our goals and improve our services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to making our data open and accessible to our employees and partners, while also protecting the privacy and security of our customers and stakeholders. We will work to ensure that our data is secure, accurate, up-to-date, and relevant and that it is shared in a way that is transparent, ethical, and responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle is mostly about ensuring that people who are allowed to get data, can get it when they want it. We can control who that is, and we have to make sure we handle data following the law. This isn't creating a free for all. It's making sure we have data in useful formats, so we can make decisions with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By making data open and accessible, the company can increase transparency and accountability, both internally and externally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing data within the company and with external partners can help to improve collaboration and innovation, leading to better products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to more data can help employees and partners make better decisions, based on more accurate and up-to-date information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By sharing data, the company can avoid duplication of effort and reduce costs, leading to greater efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By being open and transparent with data, the company can improve its reputation and build trust with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.&amp;quot; - Helen Keller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if every computer had different software and hardware that didn’t work with other computers. It would be very hard to share information or do things together. That’s why we have standards to make sure that our software and hardware can work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standards help us in many ways. They make sure that everything works together smoothly so that we can manage our systems better and be happy with what we are doing. They also help us save money by making sure that we don’t have to buy new things all the time because everything works together well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to use an open, standardised well-trodden path of technology. Most of the problems we solve can use existing technologies and we need to be able to work with new vendors and with unknown new systems, services and software. Open standards help us do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, people might want to do something different. But if we do that, it might make it harder to use or integrate. So, you have to have a really good reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make sure that everyone/everything is following the same rules and playing together nicely, we need to have a way of checking that everyone is doing what they’re supposed to be doing. We also need to make sure that we keep checking the rules every once in a while to make sure that they still work and are fair for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before we can start playing the game, we need to know what we’re playing with. So, we need to find out what things we already have and how they work. This way, we can make sure that everything works together nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.&amp;quot; - Steve Jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications are easy to use. The underlying technology is transparent to users, so they can concentrate on the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use something, it’s better if you don’t have to learn too much about how it works. It’s easier to use when it’s simple. This makes it easier for you to do your work and not make mistakes. It keeps data in the right places and reduces the likelihood of people mistreating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our software to be easy to use and accessible to the biggest audience we can serve. We do not, ever, want the complexity of our systems to hinder a sale or add any impediment to our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps and websites should look and feel similar to each other and be easy to use. So, there are rules that are made to make sure that all applications follow these standards. These rules are tested to make sure that they are easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people make things like websites or apps, they should not assume that everyone who uses them is the same. They should make sure that everyone can use them no matter where they are from, what language they speak, how much they know about computers, or if they have any physical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Make room for the real important stuff.” —Tigger”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on what matters to our customers, to make sure we deliver a great service they want to use, with the resources we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand what really matters to your customers, the core of your business, versus the stuff you have to do around it, the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to focus your efforts on Core matters, not context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing your efforts on Core matters will ensure you focus on the problems and challenges your customers have and how you can deliver value to them. This will maximise your oppotrtunity with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on context will eat into your time, and few customers will thank you for it. This doesn't mean its not important, but it does mean you need to control the amount of time, money and energy spent on context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core problems are the things we do that create customer value. We want to give ourselves the most time to do these. Context problems are things we do because we have, to make sure we're compliant, paid, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to minimise context problems and maximise the focus we can give Core problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contextual problems should be considered for outsourcing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corte problems could be assisted by outsourcing, but must remain withint the purview of the business. This could be done to get past a skill gap or short deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context problems are best 'leased' rather than built. Outsourcing services for these things will let an expert manage it and ultimately save time/money/energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core problems need to minimise dependencies and maximise local control, to ensure the business can adapt.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The more complex the system, the greater the room for error.” — George Soros&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to use a limited number of technologies to reduce the cost of maintaining expertise in and connectivity between multiple systems. By doing so, we minimize the complexity of our systems and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When companies use too many different technologies to do things, it can be very expensive to keep everything working together. So, companies try to use fewer technologies to make things simpler and cheaper. This way, they can save money and make things work better. It’s like having fewer toys to play with so you don’t have to worry about cleaning them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be clear, we like diversity. But technical diversity is different, as it's more about the ecosystem of compatibility, than any intrinsic bias. We want to choose a simple path and different vendors will complicate matters, standards and interoperability. So we are careful with who we pick and who we invite in, as we all want an easier life, with less waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we choose which technologies to use, we have to follow certain rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These rules help us choose technologies that work well together and are easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we need to use a new technology that is not in the rules, we have to make sure it works with the other technologies we are already using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also have to make sure it will make things better or easier and not harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rules-for-technical-choices"&gt;Rules for technical choices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Wherever law ends, Tyranny begins. - John Locke, 1972&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our processes for the optimization, storage, and processing of the data we create and use, follow all the relevant laws, policies and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise policy refers to a set of rules and guidelines that an organization creates to govern its actions. Part of our enterprise policy is to comply with laws, policies, and regulations. However, this does not prevent business process improvements that may lead to changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle tells us to follow the law and associated good practices. Areas of our business are regulated, and we are bound by law for the countries we work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enterprise must comply with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, and management of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees must be educated about these rules and have access to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will adapt our processes and applications as the law and regulations change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Don’t say ‘infinitely’ when you mean ‘very’; otherwise you’ll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite.&amp;quot; - George Orwell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the company agrees on what data means, and they can easily find and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to use the same words for the data we use to make apps. This will help us share data and talk better. It will also help us connect systems and move data between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle aims to help us keep things deliberately simple and to make sure we all use the same words to describe the same things. Not following this principle causes confusion and delay, and affects our work. Deliberately keeping things simple helps us all communicate effectively, without ego, and ensures we can be as productive as possible. It also helps us communicate with customers, people from outside our industry and people with other language backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who are supposed to take care of important information don’t always do a good job. We need to make sure they have enough help and resources so they can do their job better. This will help us make sure we have good information that we can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to create a list of words that everyone in the company will use in the same way. This will help everyone understand each other better and avoid confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we need to make up a new word or phrase to describe something, we have to check with other people in the company to make sure that everyone agrees on what it means. This way, everyone can understand what the new word or phrase means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will nominate someone to provide this coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to have a common understanding of data across an organization instead of having different definitions of data in different places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data initiatives need to be coordinated, with centralised management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone, within each part of the organisation, has to be accountable for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Start thinking of security as soon as possible in the design process. It's practically impossible to effectively retrofit security. Adding security to an application is an attitude to everything you do from concept to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't need to be onerous, but it is important to start with security in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
