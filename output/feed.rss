			<content:encoded>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Data management is the organisation of people, processes and technologies to create and maintain a reliable data environment for master data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="xref:a-tale-of-two-customers"&gt;The Tale of Two Customers (James B &amp;amp; Bing AI, 2023)&lt;/a&gt; shows how well-understood, linked Master Data can help improve customer experience and business success. It talks about two experiences of customer service, one positive and one negative, through the eyes of Alice (who has a good experience) and Bob (who has a bad one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we've all been Alice or Bob at some point, and it's likely that when we felt like Alice, we used the company again. And when we felt like Bob, we avoided them and repeatedly told our friends and family about the poor experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="master-data"&gt;Master Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Data is a confusing term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article refers to 'the critical information required to run the organisation' as 'Master Data'. Each department may have its own. Acquisitions will have their own. Partners will have their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we ensure our Enterprise has an up-to-date, single view of the customer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Managing our Master Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Data management (MDM) is the organisation of people, processes and technologies to create and maintain data in a way which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authoritative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great if you are lucky enough to have a single system which everyone uses to track orders, shipments, payments and work items. Your data is already probably mastered and accurate. A design like this is a business's 'gold standard' of information management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's rarely found in any but the smallest or largest organisations. Small organisations cope with limited systems. The larger ones invest heavily in creating designs that match their processes and allow this interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, we need to understand and link data to simplify our work and limit the expense of supporting our customers while offering them a great experience they want to return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy access to a single record system eases and supports the business. Each area may use a different database system, but as long as the resulting view is consistent, this will not harm the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we want to try and limit the number of systems customer-facing colleagues are using. They should be able to work in one place to ease training and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDM involves creating or documenting a master record for each entity in the company's central processes to synchronise this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single source can be decentralised, consolidated or any other shape you can imagine as long as the data source and the data relationships are understood, and the outcome results in an ability to see the whole picture about a customer, reseller, product or other important entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mdm-strategy"&gt;MDM Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MDM strategy sets the tone for the project, outlining why its important and what the expectations are for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-to-build-a-data-architecture-to-drive-innovation-today-and-tomorrow"&gt;McKinsey cites modern data architecture&lt;/a&gt; as a critical business driver, but it can be one of the most expensive projects a company can take on. A Strategy to adopt the right data capability for the organisation's growth and maturity is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Everflow, our mission is to simplify our customer's utility needs. We need to understand their use of utilities and be able to track how we can align their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our MDM strategy reflects our business goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a single view of the customer and their use of our products, so they can quickly see how their usage varies and make educated decisions. Providing this joined-up view allows our 'single quote' and 'single bill' initiatives to succeed and scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To support their brokers and support agents to get the correct information quickly and easily, so we can continue to deliver excellent customer service.
To support and not detract from our main value proposition by offering a lightweight solution which aligns with our values and principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will achieve these goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By identifying and managing our Core Master Data, required to create integrated customer experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through maintaining authoritative sources, which the broader organisation can easily access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring our data stewardship is fit for purpose as our regulated footprint grows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By providing a lightweight service which delivers the necessary functionality in a cost-effective manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Everflow, MDM is a critical enabler to our business goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows us to create a single view of the customer, their active contracts, and potential upsells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable us to analyse broker performance and see how different brokers do in other areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate new systems and master customer records, quotes and billing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy outlines how to achieve this and gain short-term benefits incrementally. The outcomes align with the organisation's goals and explain how MDM is necessary to deliver those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this article will describe the project necessary to create such a hub and what types of tools will be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="method"&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MDM process involves several stages. Not all are essential, but some have to come first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*75EtrzKzZUb0nfPd8VT9qw.png" alt="10 Steps to a Successful MDM Project"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedlbauer, M. (2019) Master Data Management, shipzero. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/appanion/10-steps-towards-a-successful-master-data-management-project-1322e20d2241"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="goal-define-business-outcomes"&gt;1. Goal - Define Business Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important step. Things only happen when there is a tangible goal for the business. MDM drives two main types of value streams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MDM drives a short-term return on its investment by managing inconsistencies, improving analysis and reducing the effort to visualise and analyse data. It boosts responses to customers and partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A longer-term return is the capability to model and simulate how changes affect business performance. MDM allows business modelling and testing, which can make analytics a strategic investment. It supports acquisition and integration by ensuring new systems adapt to existing data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital to maintain both the vision (Analytics as a strategic enabler) and the short-term gains (we can show value in the short term by doing -something-) when explaining the importance of MDM and a broader data strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="identification"&gt;2. Identification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="identify-master-data"&gt;Identify Master Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of any project, identify the relevant master data for that project, not all the master data you may ever need, and certainly not all the data you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following characteristics help identify Master Data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Business Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low volatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reusable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master data is only the high-value, complex, reusable entities with low volatility, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CustomerAccounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CustomerSites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BrokerAgents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical data is not necessarily master data. A Brokers training in a utility is vital for compliance, but only in that context. It is not widely reusable, so it wouldn't be considered Master Data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDM does not, and should not, include transaction data. That stuff is too fast-moving to manage using this pattern. A data warehouse or an event stream is a better way to manage analytics for transactional data. It could link to the transactional view or the analytical aggregates of the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a data warehouse point of view, Master Data fields are critical dimensions which change slowly, but not the facts about those dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://red-sand-078a6ea03.3.azurestaticapps.net/media/mdm-field-eval.png" alt="MDM Entity Analysis"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedlbauer, M. (2019) Master Data Management, shipzero. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/appanion/10-steps-towards-a-successful-master-data-management-project-1322e20d2241"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we know what they are, we can understand and expose the proper entities and their fields from the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: 'Roll-up' data into entities and resources that can be queried. Then we can work with those bigger objects, confident that we can access the contents if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="identify-evaluate-data-sources"&gt;Identify &amp;amp; Evaluate Data Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do we get this data from? Where was it created or first used? How can we trust that it is correct? These are all critical questions to ask on our journey. The next step is to identify where our Master Data comes from and whether that is a system of record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the right place to collect different data items is crucial as it lets us integrate or populate data as soon as possible in the lifecycle. Having a clear lineage for each entity increases the ability to diagnose issues with data and ensures data is more accurate and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the data lifecycle in an organisation makes the process less invasive or disruptive. Which department/system gets to the entity first? For a new product, it is likely to be Product Management. Sales probably identify a Customer first. Using these 'natural' systems as the system of record and the source of information ensures the organisation captures data soon and remains current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluate whether these systems have available interfaces to export data, ideally, modern interfaces that drive events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers comes from SalesForce via a REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokers comes from EVIE via a REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Data comes from Eclipse via a ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waste Data comes from WASTE via a ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill information comes from AllOftheAbove via a ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, having webhooks or an event model means we can quickly raise events when something changes, and each interested system can update its copy of any information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="analysis"&gt;4. Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="metadata"&gt;Metadata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining and managing metadata for a business would be an entire article or more on its own. Detailed data about your data, who created it, where they created it, when they made it and who last edited it can all add value to a business by increasing understanding of critical entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of MDM, metadata requires analysis to check for consistency across systems. Different teams and systems likely use other terms or values for the same things. It's important to align these things to create a shared language for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest solution is to add all the different, relevant metadata to the Master Data entity so that other systems can access the metadata. Then train departmental leaders in the correct terms. To allow a colleague to understand who last worked with an entity, what happened to the entity and whether it is live or stale, Metadata should include Comments, Versions, Updates and Editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what Master Data Metadata is relevant outside of the source system. Sometimes, there is no actual use outside the source, so leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="data-lifecycles"&gt;Data Lifecycles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletes the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define these items for each Master Data Domain. These lifecycles define where something is created and edited. At different steps in the lifecycle, other systems are 'the' primary source, and this can vary over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-master model is more complex to keep aligned, so avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="worked-examples"&gt;Worked examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Customer' is created in '[Broker System]' when 'Event' By 'Persona'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Customer' is updated in 'Eclipse' when 'signed up' to 'Persona'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Customer' is viewed in 'WASTE' when '...' by 'persona'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Customer' is viewed in 'EVIE' when '...' by '...'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Customer' is deleted in '...' when '...' by '...'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="involvement-appoint-data-stewards"&gt;5. Involvement - Appoint Data Stewards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have two people for each 'domain' in the department who creates and uses that entity the most. The two people should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business, from the department&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Technical', which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be from the data team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should have a working relationship for regular changes/updates and be able to make local decisions if the impact is non-breaking or within budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure"&gt;6. Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we look at tools and capabilities and decide what we have, what we need and what we would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="architecture"&gt;Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't reinvent the wheel. Choose an architecture which is closest to your identified needs and adapt that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="data-model"&gt;Data Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick an understandable data model. Ideally, use a reference model rather than invent from scratch, but don't choose one that is too big or fancy. Extensibility is essential, as is the scale of the project. It has to be something you can easily imagine finishing within a few months at most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="capabilities"&gt;Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have we got? What are we missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="toolset"&gt;Toolset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which tools fit our principles, standards and deliver the capabilities we need? Plan the missing capabilities as possible additions so you know what is available and the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="evaluate-plan-changes"&gt;Evaluate &amp;amp; Plan Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you add these to the existing estate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prototypes-and-testing"&gt;8. Prototypes and Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this, I mean testing the process of MDM as a business enabler. It must work, but it's more critical it adds value. Work with the stewards to understand pains, shortcomings, or ways to add value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Hypothesis around how data will improve a process or add value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it small and acheivable, deliver some results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow in confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something-something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="references"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional requirements describe why something is. Non-functional Requirements tell how it is. Where a customer may ask for a specific functional requirement, they are doubtful to ask for an NFR unless something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFRs which go into a product can mean all manner of differences, which affect the cost, performance, and reliability of a product or solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following requirements and how they might affect the cost or development of a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carries two passengers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can travel 200 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travels on roads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fuel efficiency greater than 30 miles per gallon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this could describe all manner of things. A motorbike? A tandem bicycle? A Sports car? These could all be right, but they meet the needs of different markets and result in differing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining how your product will perform specific tasks and how it will perform under load and in use is essential to create the proper differentiation and guidance for development.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>How Architects should work alongside Agile development to enable faster decision-making and reduce risk.</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Software and systems architects provide guidance and governance of a technology organisation by, amongst other things, modelling the organisation, its departments, capabilities, and processes and then mapping technology into them to ensure that the business has a somewhat optimised set environment, which can adapt to its needs and isn't onerous to look after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional approaches to this take time and go against the agile philosophy to avoid Big Up Front Design BUFD. How best to support developers in an agile world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common concept in an agile development organisation is 'Emergent Architecture.' But what does that mean? You follow a model more akin to evolution than planning and interfere if you see things dangerous to the organisation. You use history as a lesson, but accept what happened and don't try to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-theory"&gt;In theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development teams self-organize, the architecture role is to support decision-making and ensure good decisions thrive while poor choices don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://red-sand-078a6ea03.3.azurestaticapps.net/media/architecture-process-bpmn.png" alt="Architecture Process - BPMN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept's core work item is the ADR or Architectural Decision Record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a team has to decide something, they create a work item in Azure DevOps (other work trackers are available). This item can outline the problem in short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support US12345, we need to host semi-structured data, which will be used to render a quote on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the team decides how development will proceed, they write it down in their work system. ADRs are covered in more detail &lt;a href="xref:architecture-decision-records"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of hosting semi-structured quote data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing the need to understand different tariffs and quote them together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to host this data as JSON in a document databaseusing MongoDB interfaces hosted on Azure Cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And against using MongoDB in a seperate Container, as it would require management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or against using CosmosDB, as the interface is being deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Acheive US12345, hosting and retreiving semi-structured quote data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that there is a cost requirement in using Cosmos DB hosting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture team review and steer ADRs. ADRs are like the tweet format of designs; they encompass small decisions and choices with just enough context and reasoning to explain to a new starter why something happened. A significant benefit is that they can all be queried and exported and used to describe the project thinking over time and why the team made confident choices. The ADR list acts as a log, which someone could examine to trace the project's decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture practice reviews the ADRs and looks for trends and patterns. As certain things come to the fore, the architects write new principles, &lt;a href="xref:patterns"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="xref:nfrs"&gt;NFRs&lt;/a&gt; approved by the ARB to help the teams make future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architect group will propose amendments to the organisation's architecture to the ARB, which may require approval, depending on the size and scope of the new principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in architecture guidance are applied retrospectively but may result in the creation of new technical debt items. Similar to how the law or regulation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-practice"&gt;In Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://red-sand-078a6ea03.3.azurestaticapps.net/media/architecture-process-sequence-diagram.png" alt="Architecture Process - Sequence"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to the development team to decide how to solve problems based on the environment. The environment includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organisational Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People &amp;amp; Skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate Style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared Values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraphrased from &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/enduring-ideas-the-7-s-framework"&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company (2008) Enduring Ideas: the 7-S Framework, www.mckinsey.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people try to make good decisions. Usually, bad decisions are the result of poor communication or poor information. The architecture practice must document meaningful decisions and knowledge to help educate people so the teams can make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a feedback loop from the teams' decisions and accepting that these won't all be good, we can adjust the team's behaviour through education, exposure, and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-not-to-make-decisions"&gt;How not to make decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore existing ADRs relating to the subject (Search in DevOps for ADRs or the tech or problem).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not look at the existing guidance:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="xref:nfrs"&gt;NFRs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the decision secret right up until the last second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not produce a cost-benefit analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a slide show to confuse matters by overloading everyone with benefits without financial backing or research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-make-decisions"&gt;How to make decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the open and with the people affected by the decision, including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people who will look after it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person who has to spend money on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who will have to make it work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(If you cannot name them, then it will be you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a proposal around how it will benefit the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, seek guidance from your team or an architect. We are here to support you if you require any assistance or advice. We believe in working together and helping each other whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anti-patterns-of-architecture"&gt;Anti-patterns of architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our best efforts, sometimes architects don't get things right. We're sorry, but we're also human, like everyone else. Here's a list of problem archetypes of architects, mainly for fun and giggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ivory-tower"&gt;Ivory Tower&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too removed from the business of the organisation. They watch from on high and make proclamations while unaware of the plight of the people on the ground. This type of architect seems to create a lot of work, but it's detached from the reality and culture of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="in-the-trenches"&gt;In the trenches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too focused on their previous role, trench warriors refuse to give up their tactical responsibility and involvement and don't have time or focus for strategy. Sometimes this is because of the current state of the organisation. Sometimes it's because they don't have the exposure to build a picture of a real strategy for the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="overly-academic"&gt;Overly Academic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studious and thorough, working through frameworks and quoting luminaries, the academic cannot effectively translate these theories into practical output for the organisation. They talk about possibilities, gold standards, and best practices and sometimes focus on the areas of frameworks which aren't implemented or fully used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge and understanding of frameworks are essential, but frameworks are collections of methods that can help. Using strategies to address issues in the business is good sense. Using techniques to address symptomless 'problems' will make no friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="too-technical"&gt;Too technical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often recruited from technical areas, such as IT Operations, the too-technical architect hasn't learned to temper their language to a broader audience. Using too much technical language conversationally can result in getting typecast as another 'techie,' being sidelined from honest discussions and gaining the trust of other parts of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical skills are a real boon, though, and help when working with the more technical aspects of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="over-specialized"&gt;Over-specialized&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An architect should have a wide variety of skills and a broad understanding of most areas of their domain. If the field is too large, then specialism is a natural part of that, but an architect should work across as much of the environment as necessary, learning what they can of each part of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an architect only understands IT, they won't be able to effectively talk to Finance Partners or Legal about changes, budgets, or compliance. They may struggle to explain hosting concerns if they only know operations and not development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architects often have specialisms, but typically these start to be relinquished after they start becoming architects, moving away from specifics and into broader concepts, so they can better help explain the organisation's mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing the need to host semi-structured data close to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to use Mongo DB interfaces on Azure Cosmos DB service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And against using a Cosmos DB interface or a native Mongo DB container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify hosting the DB and to keep the database cloud agnostic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing the need to train brokers to sell utility services by the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided on a broker training log, which will confirm acceptance and record the date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve proof of training before using the system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that we will remain liable for any regulatory issues caused by the broker or their agents.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Architecture Decision Records</title>

			<description>No one reads extensive documents. ADRs are a way to capture meaningful choices so people can find them in future.</description>
			<enclosure url="https://red-sand-078a6ea03.3.azurestaticapps.net/media/header01.png" length="0" type="image" />

			<pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural decision records (ADRs) capture a crucial technical decision, the context in which it was made, and the consequences of the decision. They are used to record the project’s architectural thinking and conclusions for further reference and to help new team members understand the rationale behind the design choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADRs typically follow a template that includes the title, context, decision, status, consequences, and alternatives of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a folder or a wiki page to store ADRs. Somewhere close to the code repository and accessible to other stakeholders. You can create, review and update ADRs using tools like Azure DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="process"&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a process for creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in Azure DevOps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a template for documenting ADRs that includes the following sections: title, context, decision, status, consequences, and alternatives¹.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a folder in the Azure DevOps repository to store the ADRs. The folder name can be "adr" or "docs/adr" or something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new work item in the backlog and mark it as technical for each architectural decision. Explain the decision and alternatives in the record and link to relevant resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign the item to an engineering team based on their expertise and availability. The team should review the work item and possible solution options (3 is ideal) before deciding how to proceed and recording the decision in Markdown as a file. When writing the document, follow the template and store the output in Azure DevOps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit the ADR as a pull request and request feedback from the other teams and stakeholders. The pull request should also include any code changes that implement the decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the feedback and update the ADR document and code changes accordingly. If there are any conflicts or disagreements, resolve them through discussion and consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge the pull request and mark the feature as done. The ADR document should be 'accepted' or 'rejected' depending on the review's outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track the ADRs in a decision log that lists them by title, status, and date. The decision log can be a simple text file or a table on a Wiki page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the ADRs periodically and update them if necessary. If an ADR becomes obsolete or superseded by another decision, change its status accordingly and link to the new ADR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can help you record your architectural and technical decisions for further reference and have the new team members up to date from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A centralised Architecture team can review any ADRs made and either look to amend any of the Architecture Artefacts in response. It may be that several decisions cause a change in precedence, which requires adjusting principles or technology guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the aim of an architecture practice is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;De-risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; dictate solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the architecture needs to review and adapt to ensure it doesn't become stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="providing-short-contextual-decisions"&gt;Providing short, contextual decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a sustainable format is essential to keep decisions documentation light and relevant. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="y-statements"&gt;Y-Statements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/olzzio/y-statements-10eb07b5a177"&gt;(Wh)Y statements&lt;/a&gt;
(Borrowed from Olaf Zimmerman, an Architect at IBM.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id="worked-example"&gt;Worked Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the context&lt;/em&gt; of the business multi utility quoting tool,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facing the need to&lt;/em&gt; provide accurate and competitive quotes for gas, electricity and water services,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We decided for&lt;/em&gt; the Multi Utility Service Provider (MUSP) pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And against&lt;/em&gt; Single Utility Service Provider (SUSP) or Multiple Utility Service Providers (MUSPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To achieve&lt;/em&gt; cost savings, convenience and efficiency for our customers,
&lt;em&gt;Accepting that&lt;/em&gt; a MUSP requires more integration and coordination with different utility suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of a Y-Statement creates six phrases in three sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Context of... &lt;em&gt;(Name of the solution)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facing the need to... &lt;em&gt;(Critical challenge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We decided for... &lt;em&gt;(The winning solution)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And against... &lt;em&gt;(The other considered solutions)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Acheive... &lt;em&gt;(The main outcome)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepting that... &lt;em&gt;(Any Consequences)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because... (Optional explaination of reasoning)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each outlines a single critical point about the decision. The context and need, the 'winner' and other options considered, the expected outcome and consequences, and optional reasoning if more words are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loads of examples here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/examples"&gt;architecture-decision-record/examples&lt;/a&gt; Accessed: 31 May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="architectural-haiku"&gt;Architectural Haiku&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is the &lt;a href="https://www.georgefairbanks.com/blog/comparch-wicsa-2011-panel-discussion-and-haiku-tutorial/"&gt;Architectural Haiku&lt;/a&gt;, coined by George Fairbanks in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Architectural Haiku is a single 'slide' of information explaining a critical decision and its rationale and context. Using a 'slide' as the size of the decision artefact limits its length and duration to one page and around 3-4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter" - Blaise Pascal, 1657&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any framework or method, follow the idiom 'If in doubt, leave it out'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="version-control"&gt;Version Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version Control for your ADRs is essential so you know when they change, who changed them, and who approved them. Using your GIT repo for this is probably the most straightforward idea, as it can do these things effortlessly with the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-practice"&gt;In Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some great ADR tools are around, including ones that use a CLI or DevOps. In this instance, the aim is to use a work item in DevOps linked to a file containing the ADR text, written using Markdown. It can be changed if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a Y-Statement explaining the decision. The discussion is not essential, but the context and the discarded alternatives are.
For a more significant decision, it may be helpful to produce an Options assessment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svyatoslav Kotusev, 2013, &lt;a href="http://eaonapage.com/Enterprise%20Architecture%20on%20a%20Page%20(v2.0).pdf."&gt;Enterprise Architecture on a Page v2.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://red-sand-078a6ea03.3.azurestaticapps.net/media/eaonapage.com-options-assessment.png" alt="EA-On-A-Page, options assessment"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of ADRs is easy to find and query. Anyone can look at the recent ADRs. The architects will regularly review ADRs themselves and look to adapt the architecture as necessary, either creating or updating principles or NFRs to reduce the number of decisions which need to be made and thus recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, grab the template below, use the text in a file or work item and record those technical decisions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="template"&gt;Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-Markdown"&gt;&amp;gt; 1. In the context of...
&amp;gt; 2. Facing the need to...
&amp;gt; 3. We decided for...
&amp;gt; 4. And against...
&amp;gt; 5. To acheive...
&amp;gt; 6. Accepting that...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The team worked on a new business application allowing customers to order products online and track their delivery status. The application needed to integrate with several external systems, such as inventory management, payment processing, and shipping providers. The team had to decide how to design the integration layer and what technologies to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decided to use Azure Logic Apps as the integration platform because it offered a low-code solution to handle complex workflows and orchestration. They also decided to use Azure Service Bus as the messaging system because it provided reliable and scalable communication between the application and the external systems. They documented their decision in an ADR document that followed the template from the current web page context. They explained their decision's context, alternatives, consequences, and status. They submitted the ADR document as a pull request to the repository where they stored all their ADRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, the architect responsible for reviewing the ADRs saw their pull request and opened it. He read their document and was impressed by their reasoning and clarity. He agreed with their decision and approved the pull request. He also noticed that their decision aligned with a new architectural principle he had been thinking about for a while, &amp;quot;Use cloud-native services whenever possible to reduce complexity and increase agility&amp;quot;. He wrote an ADR document proposing this principle as a guideline for future decisions. He followed the same template and explained his proposal's context, decision, alternatives, consequences, and status. He submitted his document as a pull request to the repository where they stored all their architectural principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following week, the architectural review board met to discuss the new architectural principle. The board comprised five executives from different departments: product management, engineering, operations, security, and finance. They reviewed the document and asked questions of the architect. They debated the pros and cons of adopting cloud-native services versus building or buying custom solutions. They considered the principle's impact on cost, performance, reliability, security, and innovation. After a lively discussion, they reached a consensus and approved the principle. The architect merged the pull request and added the principle to their list of architectural principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team were happy to see the new architectural principle validated by the architect and the board. They continued to work on their application using Azure Logic Apps and Azure Service Bus. They also looked for other opportunities to apply cloud-native services in their design. They felt more confident and empowered by having clear and consistent architectural guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;h2 id="the-agile-arb"&gt;The Agile ARB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara was the chair of the Architecture Review Board (ARB) at Acme Inc., a software company that had adopted agile methods. She was passionate about creating a culture of trust and collaboration among the different teams and departments. She wanted the ARB to be a facilitator rather than a gatekeeper of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara had invited representatives from various business units, product owners, developers, testers, and architects to join the ARB, ensuring they had a clear charter and vision. The ARB met monthly to review and approve significant architectural changes that affected the whole organisation, such as introducing new technologies, standards, or patterns. They also created and maintained principles and guidelines that helped teams make sensible local decisions without waiting for the ARB’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the principles was to favour simplicity and pragmatism over complexity and perfectionism. Another was to encourage experimentation and learning from failures. A third was to seek feedback and alignment from stakeholders and customers early and often. The ARB also provided templates and tools for teams to document and communicate their architectural decisions, such as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara was proud of how the ARB had evolved from being a bottleneck to a catalyst. She saw how teams were more empowered and autonomous, how they delivered value faster and more reliably, and how they improved their quality and performance. She also saw how the ARB members learned from each other and shared their best practices across the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled as she opened her email and saw a message from one of the teams. They had successfully implemented a microservice architecture for their product, using a cloud-native platform that the ARB had approved a few months ago. They thanked the ARB for their support and guidance and shared metrics and feedback showing how their product improved scalability, availability, and user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara congratulated them and asked them if they would like to present their experience at the next ARB meeting. She thought showcasing their work and inspiring others would be an excellent opportunity. She also asked them if they had any suggestions or feedback for the ARB on improving their processes or policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She closed her email and looked at her calendar. She saw that the next ARB meeting was in two weeks. She wondered what new challenges and opportunities would come up then. She felt excited and curious. She loved her job.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;h2 id="synopsis"&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frequent perception of ARBs from Agile teams is poor and that they delay decisions and delivery. Properly implemented, an ARB allows an organisation to be more open and transparent and can empower local decision-making within a team or POD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introducing-the-arb"&gt;Introducing the ARB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-agile-arb"&gt;The Agile ARB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to write a story about an &lt;a href="xref:the-agile-arb"&gt;Agile ARB&lt;/a&gt; and its pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Architecture Review Board (ARB) is a representative group of people across the organisation who take a central role in governing architectural decisions which affect the business significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARB aims to mitigate risks to the business and improve strategic planning and awareness, especially around the use of technology and any changes to that. It does this by making it easier for front-line teams to make decisions and simplifying the overall organisation over time to keep cost and complexity at bay. An ARB does not dictate solutions. It provides a constrained space to support fast decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a Technology Review Board (TRB) and doesn't govern what technology is allowed. It regulates the processes for selecting new technologies, methods, and principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing an ARB does should be urgent. An ARB may need to determine a new principle/policy in response to an emerging issue, but such instances should be rare. The ARB should not be too slow or be unable to react quickly, but most things it needs to deal with should be at a level where the business can take some time to think about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, an ARB will meet and align following annual updates, strategic updates, or quarterly reviews. In a product-led organisation, an ARB will outline a strategic runway to ensure technology requirements (enablers) and deliverables are considered and planned following product development needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="centralised-vs-decentralised-decisions"&gt;Centralised vs Decentralised Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful ARB wants to encourage decentralised decisions as much as possible. That would be, they need to provide guidance, examples and principles that ensure people on the ground can make good decisions whilst they plan and develop processes, product features and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARB creates a kind of organisational common sense that reinforces the right way to do things, in-line with company culture and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, &lt;a href="https://www.thealternativeboard.com/blog/culture-eats-strategy"&gt;Culture eats Strategy for Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unsuccessful ARB controls every decision, which results in an unacceptable level of delay as the ARB becomes overwhelmed with small and largely inconsiquential decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="purpose"&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ARB is for reviewing and governing architecture. In this context, the ARB will make strategic decisions about how to use technology in the business rather than the specifics of what technologies to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="membership"&gt;Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ARB is a handful of relevant, cross-organizational people. Too mono-culture, and it won't be taken seriously(i.e., too many architects or technologists). Too big, and it won't make any decisions. As a cross-organizational group, it must have a diverse representation from different business areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not somewhere for architects to meet and talk. All the architects, managers, and technologists should not expect to be involved. They might watch or present in exceptional circumstances or gain exposure by acting as a proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it has to be transparent. Publish all the ARB meetings, minutes, and outcomes to the broadest possible audience. Anyone should be able to raise an issue or request a change to the ARB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="format"&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its first action should be to review its charter and accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership can be flexible, but this should be responsive to events or requirements, not just having a chaotic membership that constantly changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, it could be weekly or fortnightly, as there may be a lot of reviews and artefacts to create, in demand to business needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic Non-functional Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major Developments or Solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARB reviews should only relate to strategic solutions and projects. Most items should be small enough to avoid the ARB, and the ARB should encourage local decision-making over trying to centralise decisions. Centralised decisions should be infrequent and far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board meeting should follow a standard approach for such a meeting to ensure people are comfortable and familiar with it. Frameworks such as COBIT can provide some guidance. Here is a suggestion for an initial format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ARB Meets Monthly and in response to nominated events (PI Planning, annual review, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a Chairperson who will run and take the lead on ensuring the meeting runs as expected. Ideally, this is the sponsor, but it could be delegated or rotated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a nominated secretary who takes minutes and actions. Rotate the role, or bring someone in who needs more exposure to the ARB and strategic decision-making. It should be someone capable who will do a good job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by reviewing previous minutes and actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review any proposals or actions. Any issues should have been relayed with enough notice so that members could review what they have to before the meeting and come up with questions or requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most decisions should be able to be approved within the meeting. Deferring too many approvals is terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARB doesn't make the decisions. It provides a framework to review and guide them proactively through principles and guidance. Suppose a decision is not being made because there is inadequate direction. In that case, an ARB member should consult with another member and include advice to cover a similar future situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="frequency"&gt;Frequency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once established, a Monthly or Quarterly format should be sufficient to maintain a manageable level of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARB Meetings ideally align with any other ceremonies, such as Quarterly Planning or strategic planning, letting the ARB determine whether any specific architectural work is needed, over and above the expected level of involvement, based on upcoming work or projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="outcomes"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ARB should create the following outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements for new policies and principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements for Strategic Enablers and Capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, work from the ARB would go to the Architecture team to define, complete, or at least manage. Acceptance criteria should be a part of any of these to ensure excessive approval of the outcome is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anti-patterns"&gt;Anti-patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a selection of ways this can go wrong or things you can do poorly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive Approvals - If you find every ARB is 'full' of things to approve, then your Policies and Principles are likely irrelevant or too granular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deferred decisions - If the board makes a lot of deferrals, it would usually be because the information or risks are unclear, and they don't feel safe taking them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor reputation - The ARB may be something people dread. In this case, it's likely that the process is excessively onerous, too frequent, or that the principles are poorly accepted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology Focussed - The ARB shouldn't discuss the choice of technology. It should guide the principles and processes that result in those changes. In this case, the ARB may be too tactical, resulting in low traction across the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			<title>Technical Debt Framework</title>

			<description>Help teams manage technical debt by identifying and assessing existing debt across the enterprise and prioritising items in an orderly fashion.</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tldr"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is a hidden bleed on cost, productivity and morale. You can address it by accepting it exists, socialising the subject and putting in place ways to address it without blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main forms, process, people or technology. These relate to what you have neglected to maintain. They are best addressed as an accepted part of life, rather than with any major effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave space in your team's workflow to accommodate and address these issues and rather than being a debt which is compounding liability against your business, it will become a compounding investment, which pays for itself over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all been there. There's an urgent problem. There's software that should resolve it and make everything great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get it. And install it, and then someone doesn't quite finish installing it. And something doesn't work correctly. Or someone leaves, and now no one knows how to fix that one thing, and everyone spends time working around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have to upgrade it every few months in some complicated ritual. And the renewals seem to get more expensive and complex every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is technical debt. It's the well-meant shortcut we took to speed something up. And now, it's unmanaged and not being repaid. The business is paying 'interest' on it. And like a lot of credit, the interest can be destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="symptoms"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably have technical debt if technology or process decisions require meetings to work around or make decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If changes take a long time to make, and as such, decisions to make changes take a long time as well, you probably have technical debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If simple changes or expectable business requirements take a long time to be delivered, you probably have technical debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your developers estimate too low and deliver too late, you probably have technical debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use technology in your business, you probably have technical debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-scale-of-the-issue"&gt;The scale of the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 survey, McKinsey asked a group of CIOs on a panel what percentage of their budget was diverted to managing tech debt, and they responded that 10-20% was typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More worrying was the statistic that CIOs felt the value of the technical assets was made up of 20-40% tech debt before depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, a repeat of this study found that 60% of CIOs felt their organisation's tech debt had perceptibly increased over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, the same whitepaper quoted a former CIO at a major cloud provider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By reinventing our debt management, we went from 75 percent of engineer time paying the [tech debt] ‘tax’ to 25 percent. It allowed us to be who we are today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At WyCash in 1992, Ward Cunningham used the term Technical debt to explain to management why iterative software development was a better choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object-oriented or otherwise. — Ward Cunningham, The WyCash Portfolio Management System, 1992&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ward Cunningham was also one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analogy keeps going. Not paying technical debt, like credit cards, can swiftly compound the interest. Conversely, paying down technical debt early by refactoring in advance to improve quality is like saving. That can also compound, enhancing the agility of your software and increasing its value and productivity over time quite drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Fowler, noted author and software architect, had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I make the following definition of “refactoring”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;noun&lt;/em&gt;: a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;verb&lt;/em&gt;: to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior. -Martin Fowler, refactoring.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you push features too quickly and do not give your development teams time to refactor, reassess and improve the systems you rely on, it will get more expensive to work on. Over time, these systems become less of an asset and more of a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="types-and-causes"&gt;Types and causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is done deliberately. Market conditions, business needs, and markets all change. The assumption that machines will survive that change without proactive maintenance is disproven. So why do we not treat &amp;quot;software machines&amp;quot; or the business systems that use them with the same care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary cause is an over-focus on the immediate, without concern for the future. Short-sighted needs, month-end targets, and shareholder dividends all drive short-term thinking. &amp;quot;We'll fix it tomorrow&amp;quot; doesn't work if you don't care about tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt can be easily thought of in three types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process debt. The lack of appropriate or correct frameworks to operate modern systems in modern ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People debt. The lack of skills, knowledge and training for people to properly engage in current technologies and processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical debt. Unmaintained systems and software, where the cost to maintain or update is increased and keeps increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst most people will recognise the third, I suspect a lot ignore or don't consider the first two. I would argue the first is the most worry-some. Process debt leads shows up in phrases like 'That's not how we do that' and frustrations with 'the way things are'. It makes people feel disempowered. Being unable to make things better makes people feel helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acknowledges that education is good, but employees want to feel cared about and invested in. Ensuring that training happens is important for employee engagement, as well as productivity. It means they know how to use the systems the business invests in, as well as care about the way the business works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="framework-for-managing-technical-debt"&gt;Framework for Managing Technical Debt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt management boils down to one point. You have to pay it back. It will not go away. Factor it into daily work. If it's low, use the time to pay it forward (invest) rather than focus on the next shiny new thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author would recommend giving it up to a 25% share of the work budget to team led 'improvement', which includes tech debt. It may be that this flexes up and down a bit, but 20-25% in the long term will keep your software improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is not to remove tech debt entirely but to keep it at a workable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies need to identify and track tech debt to ensure it can be managed to the best advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech debt should be dealt with strategically. These principles, based on work from McKinsey, may help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with a shared definition of tech debt. Executive and senior management need to have the same understanding of what constitutes tech debt; Process, people and technology, which need upgrading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat tech debt as 'waste in the P&amp;amp;L' of the business. Leaders should acknowledge the capital and opportunity cost of this and have access to information and metrics to track it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the total cost of the application, its development, cost to serve, and debt are tracked. It should cover 100% of the resources necessary. If that changes how you account, then change how you account. (See 'process debt' above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an agreed process which doesn't penalise teams or people for addressing tech debt. Ensure that incentives encourage the correct behaviour and that managing tech debt is treated positively. Don't blame people for it either; someone made that decision with good intentions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have teams Create items in the product backlog with value, cost, etc., attached. Prioritise a percentage of them in every sprint to make sure tech debt is understood and visible. Treat them as features, just like others and value them. They weren't written up for the fun of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't paralyse or immobilise a business to pay tech debt. It rarely works and isn't sustainable. It encourages people to think someone will stop everything to fix things. Instead, set down time and resources in daily work to address debt consistently, proactively or reactively, depending on the team and the workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When all else fails, if a product or value stream is 'bankrupt' and can't service its debts (i.e. its 'interest' is &amp;gt;50% or so), then explore the option to replace the whole stack. It's drastic but could be a lower-risk option and save the product/service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="identifying-technical-debt"&gt;Identifying Technical Debt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to a financial analogy, you can think of tech debt as having two components, just like any other debt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The principal. This is the real work required to bring the stack, including processes and people, up to date.
The interest. is the complexity tax every single project pays. The spike works to understand how to change or use a commodity technology. The debug work to figure out how version x.x varies from x.y. This is the interest, and it's paid in productivity.
McKinsey also says that most organisations are paying way more than 10% interest on this debt, as it causes a significant drag on their projects and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.mckinsey.com/%7E/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/tech%20debt%20reclaiming%20tech%20equity/svg-tech-debt-exhibit-2.svgz?cq=50&amp;amp;cpy=Center" alt="Tech Debt Principle and Interest" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal and interest create a strong drag on enterprise value. &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-debt-reclaiming-tech-equity"&gt;Tech debt: Reclaiming tech equity | McKinsey (2020) www.mckinsey.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tracking-technical-debt"&gt;Tracking Technical Debt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech debt should be tracked by the team/group as a critical metric. You may have to find a way to expose or count the cost of this debt, which isn't always easy. Some areas you can track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Development
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://linearb.io/blog/what-is-code-complexity/"&gt;Complexity&lt;/a&gt; - Various code complexity metrics can be tracked and monitored on each project to understand where the complexity lies and help identify areas which need work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzone.com/articles/8-top-metrics-for-measuring-your-technical-debt"&gt;New Bugs vs Closed Bugs&lt;/a&gt; - Are your bugs growing or falling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-measure-technical-debt/#:%7E:text=Measuring%20Technical%20Debt%3A%20Identify%20High-Risk%20Areas%201%20Keep,Risk%20and%20Add%20Importance%20to%20the%20Mix%20"&gt;Testing Effort&lt;/a&gt; - An easy approximation is to look at test coverage. Test coverage isn't a golden bullet by any means; whilst a low value is a warning, a high volume doesn't mean the tests are good; coverage can show how well-understood a code base is. As such, have a threshold, such as 80%, as a target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure - Track the cost to service and host the application. Compare the current choice with the preferred pattern for hosting the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectural - Does the application follow the organisation's standards and recommendations? Does it follow the vendor's deployment guidance? If it is non-standard, then it will be more expensive/riskier to host and fix. It may cause complexity to host and manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training - Do you need to hire people for every new technology? Are your team unable to spend time looking at potentially valuable new tools and technologies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you mix these with importance and risk, you can approximate the 'value' and start to create a backlog of tech debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="managing-technical-debt"&gt;Managing Technical Debt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your teams identify tech debt and create features in their existing backlogs for tech debt. Tag them with 'Tech-debt', so they can be reported on and analysed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not create a separate backlog. This will slow things down. One team, one backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track each feature with risk and importance. This includes tech debt. During sprint planning, pull tech debt items into the backlog to fill up the first 25%. Feel free to move some out to make way for important features, but prioritise debt over 'Should' or 'Could' features.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, each debt you deal with gives you more bandwidth tomorrow. The compound interest of tech debt payoff can be huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your product managers understand the value of this work and support it. They need to be able to prioritise tech debt and understand what that budget is doing and where it is going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is a shortcut that was made to speed something up. It’s a lack of appropriate or correct frameworks to operate modern systems in modern ways. It’s the lack of skills, knowledge and training for people to properly engage in current technologies and processes. It’s unmaintained systems and software, where the cost to maintain or update is increased and keeps increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business has these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical debt management boils down to one point. Pay it back. The goal is not to remove tech debt but to keep it at a workable level. Companies need to identify and track tech debt to ensure it can be managed to the best advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
