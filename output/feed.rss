&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Wherever law ends, Tyranny begins. - John Locke, 1972"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our processes for the optimization, storage, and processing of the data we create and use, follow all the relevant laws, policies and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise policy refers to a set of rules and guidelines that an organization creates to govern its actions. Part of our enterprise policy is to comply with laws, policies, and regulations. However, this does not prevent business process improvements that may lead to changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle tells us to follow the law and associated good practises. Areas of our business are regulated, and we are bound by lawa for the countries we work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enterprise must comply with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, and management of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees must be educated about these rules and have access to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will adapt our processes and applications as as the law and regulations change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<title>Common Vocabulary</title>
			<link>https://red-sand-078a6ea03.3.azurestaticapps.net/posts/common-vocabulary.html</link>
			<description>Everyone in the company agrees on what data means, and they can easily find and understand it.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Don’t say ‘infinitely’ when you mean ‘very’; otherwise you’ll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite." - George Orwell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the company agrees on what data means, and they can easily find and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to use the same words for the data we use to make apps. This will help us share data and talk better. It will also help us connect systems and move data between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle aims to help us keep things deliberately simple and to make sure we all use the same words to describe the same things. Not following this principle causes confusion and delay, and affects our work. Deliberately keeping things simple helps us all communicate effectively, without ego, and ensures we can be as productive as possible. It also helps us communicate with customers, people from outside our industry and people with other language backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who are supposed to take care of important information don’t always do a good job. We need to make sure they have enough help and resources so they can do their job better. This will help us make sure we have good information that we can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to create a list of words that everyone in the company will use in the same way. This will help everyone understand each other better and avoid confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we need to make up a new word or phrase to describe something, we have to check with other people in the company to make sure that everyone agrees on what it means. This way, everyone can understand what the new word or phrase means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will nominate someone to provide this coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to have a common understanding of data across an organization instead of having different definitions of data in different places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data initiatives need to be coordinated, with centralised management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone, within each part of the organisation, has to be accountable for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			<title>Business Continuity</title>

			<description>Business keeps going even when systems break down.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I can be changed by what happens to me, but I refuse to be reduced by it." - Maya Angelou.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business keeps going even when systems break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure our systems work well because we use them a lot. We must think about how to avoid problems as we design and use them. We should be able to keep doing our work no matter what happens. Things like broken machines, bad weather, or wrong data cannot stop us. We must have different ways to use information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle ensures that we focus on ensuring our business is adequately resilient and prepared. It encourages us to look for tangible risks and effective mitigations, which are appropriate to the value of the system. It also wants us to focus on ensuring that our applications fit our intentions, especially regarding where we work and how easy it is for our people to adapt to changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data and Applications are available to our staff when they work away from the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use shared applications, you need to know (and control) the risks of losing your business data and business functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can control the risks by checking systems regularly, testing for problems, and/or having backup plans for important services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should think about how to recover, replace, and maintain your applications when you design them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should know how important your applications are for your business, and what kind of recovery plans you need for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
