			<description>Security is a critical concern of any organisation. The requirements will help you baseline security need and understand the risks in your app.</description>

&lt;li&gt;Is there any confidential or financial data to be passed? Does the audience/user get the impression this is taken seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we using the relevant browser guidelines to make sure everything 'looks' as secure as it should?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the customers expectation of adequate security? Does it need MFA? OTP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we transparent about security and standards? Do we follow the relevant guidance? Is this clear and easy to see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, these are absolutes. They should apply to everything.
a. Any PII should be encrypted from the client, and when stored.
b. Access to any PII should require strong authentication.
The site will use HTTPS all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Can the audience complete their job in a single visit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly can they complete their task?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the design require training? Is it intuitive and guided enough to be easy to complete on the first attempt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many errors does a typical user make? Are they clear and any remedial actions clear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<title>Composability</title>

			<description>Services that can be combined and reused, composed into different layouts and new applications, provide business agility.</description>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">/posts/composability</guid>
			<pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 10:52:36 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Composability is a non-functional requirement which allows us to integrate several services together. The high level intent is that a service should be self-contained and stateless, so the system can be trusted, but also reused and integrated as needs evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>Ensuring whatever we build has broad compatibility means we build for common target system architecture.</description>

&lt;li&gt;Drives the target deployment system. Too tight and it affects supply and scale. Too restrictive and it becomes harder to grow and support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a commodity normal environment, which is easy to reproduce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a readily available architecture, the more commodity the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host on a 'normal' image. Slowly evolve so everything uses that image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be somewhat specific, but not into the versions. Specify minimum versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to using APIs to communicate between services to minimise compatibility issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use Ubuntu (LTS) with dotnet &amp;gt;3.0, on an amd64 architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions are fine when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Compatibility requirements - IBM Documentation&lt;/li&gt;

			<title>Performance</title>
			<link>/posts/performance</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Typically, we would look at the 95th percentile of results for these, so you don't have to be 100% perfect, but you should be 95% on target, with an aim to be 100%.
a. A user login to the system should complete within 1 second.
b. All pages should render 'on the glass' within 1 second.
The system can support at least 25 concurrent page 'views' per second.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• It's important to understand the expected workload of your system and the expected growth. This needs to be a baseline, expected service for a given user.
• Do expect it to be successful, but don’t build in excess fixed resource; that's just wasteful. Make sure performance and scalability are considered together.
• Ignore third party delivery times. You need to either find a service which meets your Requirements or you need to use an adequate pattern to abstract this. You have minimal control of the service, so ensure you protect yourself form it.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is also a compromise between commodity and available skillsets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• Maintenance costs are critical. A service which costs too much prevents reinvestment and adjustment.
• Stuff will go wrong. Make sure it's easy to fix and look after. This is an area where you can outsource some of it (Cloud services can be good here)

	a. Minimise collateral damage when making changes.
	b. Use loosely coupled patterns, to ensure asynchronous operations, so we can make changes during normal working hours.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a compromise between commodity and available skillsets.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Compliance with Law</title>
			<link>/posts/compliance-with-law</link>
			<description>As we create and store data, we stick to the rules and regulations.</description>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">/posts/compliance-with-law</guid>
			<pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 10:25:04 GMT</pubDate>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Wherever law ends, Tyranny begins. - John Locke, 1972"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statement"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our processes for the optimization, storage, and processing of the data we create and use, follow all the relevant laws, policies and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rationale"&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise policy refers to a set of rules and guidelines that an organization creates to govern its actions. Part of our enterprise policy is to comply with laws, policies, and regulations. However, this does not prevent business process improvements that may lead to changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle tells us to follow the law and associated good practises. Areas of our business are regulated, and we are bound by lawa for the countries we work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enterprise must comply with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, and management of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees must be educated about these rules and have access to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will adapt our processes and applications as as the law and regulations change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
